## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([rehype][]) plugin that compiles HTML (hast) to
React nodes (the virtual DOM that React uses).

**unified** is a project that transforms content with abstract syntax trees
(ASTs).
**rehype** adds support for HTML to unified.
**hast** is the HTML AST that rehype uses.
This is a rehype plugin that adds a compiler to compile hast to React nodes.

## When should I use this?

This plugin adds a compiler for rehype, which means that it turns the final
HTML (hast) syntax tree into something else (in this case, a React node).
Itâ€™s useful when youâ€™re already using unified (whether remark or rehype) or are
open to learning about ASTs (theyâ€™re powerful!) and want to render content in
your React app.

If youâ€™re not familiar with unified, then [`react-markdown`][react-markdown]
might be a better fit.
You can also use [`react-remark`][react-remark] instead, which is somewhere
between `rehype-react` and `react-markdown`, as it does more that the former and
is more modern (such as supporting hooks) than the latter, and also a good
alternative.
If you want to use JavaScript and JSX *inside* markdown files, use [MDX][].

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-react
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import rehypeReact from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-react@7?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeReact from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-react@7?min'
</script>
```

## Use

Say our React app module `example.js` looks as follows:

```js
import {createElement, Fragment, useEffect, useState} from 'react'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeReact from 'rehype-react'

const text = `<h2>Hello, world!</h2>
<p>Welcome to my page ðŸ‘€</p>`

function useProcessor(text) {
  const [Content, setContent] = useState(Fragment)

  useEffect(() => {
    unified()
      .use(rehypeParse, {fragment: true})
      .use(rehypeReact, {createElement, Fragment})
      .process(text)
      .then((file) => {
        setContent(file.result)
      })
  }, [text])

  return Content
}

export default function App() {
  return useProcessor(text)
}
```

Assuming that runs in Next.js, Create React App (CRA), or similar, weâ€™d get:

```html
<h2>Hello, world!</h2>
<p>Welcome to my page ðŸ‘€</p>
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `rehypeReact`.

### `unified().use(rehypeReact, options)`

Compile HTML to React nodes.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: this compiler returns a React node where compilers typically
> return `string`.
> When using `.stringify`, the result is such a React node.
> When using `.process` (or `.processSync`), the result is available at
> `file.result`.

##### `options`

Configuration (optional).

###### `options.createElement`

How to create elements or components (`Function`, required).
You should typically pass `React.createElement`.

###### `options.Fragment`

Create fragments instead of an outer `<div>` if available (`symbol`).
You should typically pass `React.Fragment`.

###### `options.components`

Override default elements (such as `<a>`, `<p>`, etc.) by passing an object
mapping tag names to components (`Record<string, Component>`, default: `{}`).

For example, to use `<MyLink>` components instead of `<a>`, and `<MyParagraph>`
instead of `<p>`, so something like this:

```js
  // â€¦
  .use(rehypeReact, {
    createElement: React.createElement,
    components: {
      a: MyLink,
      p: MyParagraph
    }
  })
  // â€¦
```

###### `options.prefix`

React key prefix (`string`, default: `'h-'`).

###### `options.passNode`

Pass the original hast node as `props.node` to custom React components
(`boolean`, default: `false`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports an `Options` type, which specifies the interface of the accepted
options.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

This plugin works with `rehype-parse` version 3+, `rehype` version 4+, and
`unified` version 9+, and React 16+.

## Security

Use of `rehype-react` can open you up to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss]
attack if the tree is unsafe.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to make the tree safe.
